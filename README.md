This is a network design and configuration project done wih Cisco Packet Tracer
In this project I: 
Designed a network topology for ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Configured Router0 with two subnets (192.168.40.0/25 and 192.168.40.128/25), assigning proper IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to all interfaces.

Deployed 2960-24TT switches in each department and connected them to multiple PCs and printers using appropriate cables.

Configured PCs and printers with valid IPs and default gateways to enable communication across the network.

Tested end-to-end connectivity with ping commands to verify that DELIVERY PCs could successfully reach ACCOUNTS PCs.
